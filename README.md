ðŸŒ¸ Habit Tracker Web App
A minimal yet effective habit tracking web app designed to help users stay consistent with their daily goals. With a soft pink aesthetic, the interface gives off a cozy, friendly vibe to make habit tracking more enjoyable and approachable.

This app allows users to:

Add and remove habits dynamically

Track daily progress visually

View total completion stats in real time

Maintain accountability through a clean and responsive UI

Built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is ideal for beginners exploring DOM manipulation, event handling, and interactive UI development.

This is just the beginning future versions will evolve as I dive deeper into the MERN stack, where I plan to add features like authentication, user dashboards, cloud-based progress saving, and more.

Perfect for anyone looking to build better habits or learn core web development skills through hands-on practice all wrapped in a cute and calming design.
